This is a bad moment for our project, We cannot continue without plan. 
Please fix this before you do any other activity with us in the department. 
Currently there are lot of financial loses due to your team results and the future do not look to bright. 
It's possible that our project will close if we don't do something, fast. 
Let me know if you found any solution in the tommorow's afternoon meeting.
