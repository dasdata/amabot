# Less email, more productivity
With OpenReplAI you do not have to stop everything what you do when you receive an email, like today.

OpenReplAI is an AI-system that can process long emails and reads back to you the essentials as in an executive summary. 
No matter if you receive a positive, negative or mixed message, based on the sentiment and key phrases a personalized response will be context generated. 

Finally, you can easily confirm sending or modify the reply before it is sent.
